<p>
    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how our "Spam Email Detection" application collects, uses, and protects your information, specifically regarding your Gmail data.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
    To effectively identify and filter spam emails, our application requires access to your Gmail account using the <code>https://mail.google.com/</code> scope. We collect the following data:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Email headers (including sender, recipient, subject, and date).</li>
    <li>Email body content (including plain text and HTML).</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We do not collect any other personal data beyond what is necessary for spam detection.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>
    The email data we collect is used solely for the purpose of identifying and filtering spam emails. Our application analyzes email patterns, content, and sender information to determine if an email is likely to be spam.
</p>

<p>
    The data is stored temporarily on our servers during the analysis process. After spam detection is completed, the data is deleted. We do not retain your email data for any longer than is necessary for spam detection.
</p>

<p>
    We do not share your email data with any third parties.
</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>
    We implement reasonable security measures to protect your email data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
